# Comparison

Frontends for tradeflow data with a UN Goal focus.

1. Create a folder for your work using your unique handle (loren, etc).
2. Prepare a vibe prompt in your readme and post a link to your page in our Discord.
3. Gather feedback from others and refine your vibe prompt.

TO DO:

Generate a .md page that the "comparison" repo can use by providing Claude Code CLI with logic for the names of files and columns in tradeflow/[year]/[country]. And include ideas on how the files could be used for comparisons.

Generate the overview by running Claude in the exiobase/tradeflow folder.  
We're not using the scripts external that are external to tradeflow folder.
