### Data Files

For each country and year, there are 8 files generated by the exibase/tradeflow python to use in the dynamic comparison reports.  
These reside in each year folder in the [trade-data repo](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year) at trade-data/[year]/[country]

Two of the files reside external to the country folders: [factor.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/factor.csv) and [industry.csv](https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/blob/main/year/2019/industry.csv)

Join those to each country's six annual tradeflow files in the [year]/[country] folder at:

imports/trade.csv
imports/trade_factor.csv
exports/trade.csv
exports/trade_factor.csv
domestic/trade.csv
domestic/trade_factor.csv

These files above will also be used as table names in an SQL database instance for each year.

Other files are redundant and reproduce what's in the trade_factor.csv files above.
The exception is files starting with bea, which contain US state data.

### Country Select (Legend)

Our country legend resides in the [timeline](../localsite/timeline/) javascript


### Separated-Chord Chart

The following separated-chord chart is good to reuse for comparing industries (sectors) and impacts (indicators):
[/profile/footprint/sector_supply_impacts.html](/profile/footprint/sector_supply_impacts.html)

Keep the separated-chord javascript in its existing location at:
/profile/footprint/chord/stretched/chordInit.js
/profile/footprint/chord/stretched/script.js
