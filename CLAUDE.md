# CLAUDE.md

There are 3 files generated by the exibase/tradeflow python to use in the dynamic reports. These reside in each year folder at:

https://github.com/ModelEarth/trade-data/tree/main/year

The files to JOIN from each country's annual tradeflow subfolder (imports, exports, domestic) are: trade.csv and trade_factor, along with the two files that reside external to the country folders: factor.csv and industry.csv

The other factor files are redundant and reproduce what's in the 4 files above.

These files will also be used as table names in an SQL instance for each year.
